# Question-Answer Hallucination Detection Task with Chain-of-Thought

You are a hallucination detection expert specializing in question-answer scenarios. Your task is to identify hallucinated content in an answer by comparing it with the provided reference passages and question context.

**Important: You must use Chain-of-Thought (step-by-step reasoning) to analyze the task before providing your final answer.**

## Input Format
**Question:**
{{ question }}

**Reference Passages:**
{{ reference }}

**Generated Answer:**
{{ response }}

## Output Format Requirements **[CRITICAL]**

**You must strictly follow this JSON format without deviation:**

### Standard Case (With or Without Hallucinations)
Output a JSON object with `reasoning` and `hallucination_list` fields:
```json
{
  "reasoning": {
    "question_analysis": "Step 1: Analyze the question and identify what information is being requested",
    "answer_analysis": "Step 2: Break down the answer content and identify all factual claims",
    "reference_verification": "Step 3: Verify each answer claim against the reference passages systematically",
    "hallucination_identification": "Step 4: Identify specific content that contradicts or lacks support from passages",
    "final_assessment": "Step 5: Provide overall evaluation of answer faithfulness to reference material"
  },
  "hallucination_list": ["exact span 1", "exact span 2", ...] 
}
```

### No Hallucinations Case
```json
{
  "reasoning": {
    "question_analysis": "Analysis of what the question asks for...",
    "answer_analysis": "Breakdown of answer content and claims...",
    "reference_verification": "Verification that all claims are supported by passages...",
    "hallucination_identification": "No unsupported or contradictory content found",
    "final_assessment": "Answer is faithful to reference passages and addresses the question appropriately"
  },
  "hallucination_list": []
}
```

### Output Constraints
- **Strictly prohibit explanatory text, code block markers, or extra symbols**
- **Strictly prohibit any other format**
- **Reasoning object must contain all 5 fields, even if some steps are not applicable**
- Each span in hallucination_list must be a string (with quotes)
- Empty list must be `[]` (without quotes)

=========================
## Reasoning Steps Explanation

### Step 1: question_analysis
Analyze the question to understand:
- **Information type requested**: factual data, explanation, comparison, evaluation, etc.
- **Scope and specificity**: broad topic vs. specific details, temporal constraints, entity focus
- **Expected answer format**: quantitative data, descriptive explanation, yes/no, list, etc.
- **Context requirements**: what background information is needed for a complete answer

**Example**: "Question asks for specific diagnosis and treatment details for a patient, requiring factual medical information with precision."

### Step 2: answer_analysis
Break down the answer systematically:
- **Factual claims**: specific statements that can be verified (names, numbers, dates, procedures)
- **Descriptive content**: qualitative assessments, explanations, relationships
- **Attribution patterns**: how information is presented (definitive vs. uncertain language)
- **Answer completeness**: whether the response adequately addresses the question

**Example**: "Answer makes definitive claims about pneumonia diagnosis and 10-day antibiotic treatment, uses confident language without hedging."

### Step 3: reference_verification
Systematically check answer claims against reference passages:
- **Direct support**: Claims explicitly stated in passages
- **Inferential support**: Claims reasonably derivable from passage information
- **Partial support**: Claims partially supported but with gaps or ambiguities
- **No support**: Claims without any basis in the reference material
- **Contradictory evidence**: Claims that conflict with passage information

**Example**: "Passages mention respiratory infection and antibiotic prescription, but specify bronchitis (not pneumonia) and do not mention treatment duration."

### Step 4: hallucination_identification
Categorize and identify specific hallucinations:
- **Factual contradictions**: Claims that directly oppose passage information
- **Unsupported specifics**: Precise details not found in passages (exact numbers, names, timeframes)
- **Fabricated relationships**: Causal or logical connections not supported by passages
- **Attribution errors**: Misassigned sources, quotes, or authorities
- **Context distortions**: Information taken out of context or misrepresented

**Example**: "Identified hallucinations: 'pneumonia' contradicts passage's 'bronchitis'; '10 days' is unsupported specific detail not mentioned in passages."

### Step 5: final_assessment
Provide comprehensive evaluation:
- **Overall faithfulness**: How well the answer adheres to reference material
- **Severity assessment**: Impact of identified hallucinations on answer quality
- **Question alignment**: Whether the answer appropriately addresses the original question
- **Confidence level**: How certain you are about the hallucination identification

=========================
## Hallucination Detection Rules

### What Constitutes Hallucination
Content in the answer that:
- **Contradicts information explicitly stated in the reference passages**
- **Makes factual claims not supported by any information in the reference passages**
- **Contains incorrect numbers, dates, names, statistics, or technical details**
- **Fabricates quotes, citations, or specific claims not found in the passages**
- **Misrepresents relationships, causality, or context from the reference material**

### What Does NOT Constitute Hallucination
- **Reasonable inferences drawn from the reference passages**
- **Connecting information from multiple passages in a logical way**
- **Paraphrasing or rephrasing reference content while preserving meaning**
- **Natural language variations that don't change factual content**
- **General knowledge that's consistent with the reference material**
- **Appropriate hedging language (e.g., "may", "likely", "appears to")**

### Special Considerations for Q&A
- **Question relevance**: The answer should address the question using information from passages
- **Attribution accuracy**: Claims should be traceable to specific reference passages
- **Context preservation**: Information should maintain its original context and meaning
- **Completeness vs. accuracy**: Focus on factual accuracy rather than completeness

=========================
## Span Extraction Requirements **[CRITICAL]**

### Exact Substring Rule
- Each hallucinated span MUST be copied EXACTLY character-by-character from the answer
- Think of it as using Ctrl+C to copy a text fragment from the original answer
- **DO NOT modify, paraphrase, summarize, or correct any text**
- Preserve all spelling, grammar, punctuation, and spacing exactly as it appears

### Granularity Rules
- **You CANNOT mark the entire answer as hallucination**
- Even if the answer has multiple issues, identify only specific problematic spans
- Each span should be a meaningful fragment (phrase, sentence, or clause level)
- **Avoid overly granular word-by-word marking unless necessary**

=========================
## Examples

**Example 1: Medical Diagnosis Contradiction**
- Question: "What was the patient's diagnosis?"
- Reference: "Patient was diagnosed with bronchitis and given antibiotics"
- Answer: "The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and prescribed antibiotics for 10 days"
- Valid Output:
```json
{
  "reasoning": {
    "question_analysis": "Question requests specific medical diagnosis information",
    "answer_analysis": "Answer provides definitive diagnosis (pneumonia) and specific treatment duration (10 days)",
    "reference_verification": "Reference supports bronchitis diagnosis and antibiotic treatment, but contradicts pneumonia and doesn't specify duration",
    "hallucination_identification": "Two hallucinations: wrong diagnosis (pneumonia vs bronchitis) and unsupported treatment duration (10 days)",
    "final_assessment": "Answer contains significant factual errors contradicting reference material"
  },
  "hallucination_list": ["pneumonia", "10 days"]
}
```

**Example 2: No Hallucinations**  
- Question: "What did the study conclude?"
- Reference: "The study concluded that exercise improves mental health outcomes"
- Answer: "The study concluded that regular exercise can improve mental health outcomes"
- Valid Output:
```json
{
  "reasoning": {
    "question_analysis": "Question asks for study conclusions about exercise and mental health",
    "answer_analysis": "Answer provides conclusion about exercise benefits with slight elaboration (regular exercise)",
    "reference_verification": "Reference directly supports the conclusion, 'regular' is reasonable inference from context",
    "hallucination_identification": "No contradictions or unsupported claims identified",
    "final_assessment": "Answer faithfully represents reference conclusion with appropriate paraphrasing"
  },
  "hallucination_list": []
}
```

**Example 3: Fabricated Specifics**
- Question: "Who conducted the research?"
- Reference: "Research was conducted by a team of scientists"
- Answer: "Dr. Smith, lead researcher at Harvard University, conducted this groundbreaking research published in Nature journal"
- Valid Output:
```json
{
  "reasoning": {
    "question_analysis": "Question asks for identification of research personnel",
    "answer_analysis": "Answer provides specific researcher name, institution, publication details, and qualitative assessment",
    "reference_verification": "Reference only mentions 'team of scientists' without specific names, institutions, or publications",
    "hallucination_identification": "Multiple fabricated details: specific researcher name, institution, publication venue, and 'groundbreaking' assessment",
    "final_assessment": "Answer adds substantial unverifiable details not supported by reference material"
  },
  "hallucination_list": ["Dr. Smith, lead researcher at Harvard University", "groundbreaking", "published in Nature journal"]
}
```
