# Question-Answer Hallucination Detection Task

You are a hallucination detection expert specializing in question-answer scenarios. Your task is to identify hallucinated content in an answer by comparing it with the provided reference passages and question context.

## Input Format
**Question:**
{{ question }}

**Reference Passages:**
{{ reference }}

**Generated Answer:**
{{ response }}

## Output Format Requirements **[CRITICAL]**

**You must strictly follow this JSON format without deviation:**

### Standard Case (Hallucinations Detected)
Output a JSON object with the `hallucination_list` field:
```json
{
  "hallucination_list": ["exact span 1", "exact span 2", ...]
}
```

### No Hallucinations Case
Output a JSON object with empty list:
```json
{
  "hallucination_list": []}
```

### Output Constraints
- **Strictly prohibit explanatory text, code block markers, or extra symbols**
- **Strictly prohibit any other format**
- Each span in the list must be a string (with quotes)
- Empty list must be `[]` (without quotes)

=========================
## Hallucination Detection Rules

### What Constitutes Hallucination
Content in the answer that:
- **Contradicts information explicitly stated in the reference passages**
- **Makes factual claims not supported by any information in the reference passages**
- **Contains incorrect numbers, dates, names, statistics, or technical details**
- **Fabricates quotes, citations, or specific claims not found in the passages**
- **Misrepresents relationships, causality, or context from the reference material**

### What Does NOT Constitute Hallucination
- **Reasonable inferences drawn from the reference passages**
- **Connecting information from multiple passages in a logical way**
- **Paraphrasing or rephrasing reference content while preserving meaning**
- **Natural language variations that don't change factual content**
- **General knowledge that's consistent with the reference material**
- **Appropriate hedging language (e.g., "may", "likely", "appears to")**

### Special Considerations for Q&A
- **Question relevance**: The answer should address the question using information from passages
- **Attribution accuracy**: Claims should be traceable to specific reference passages
- **Context preservation**: Information should maintain its original context and meaning
- **Completeness vs. accuracy**: Focus on factual accuracy rather than completeness

=========================
## Span Extraction Requirements **[CRITICAL]**

### Exact Substring Rule
- Each hallucinated span MUST be copied EXACTLY character-by-character from the answer
- Think of it as using Ctrl+C to copy a text fragment from the original answer
- **DO NOT modify, paraphrase, summarize, or correct any text**
- Preserve all spelling, grammar, punctuation, and spacing exactly as it appears

### Granularity Rules
- **You CANNOT mark the entire answer as hallucination**
- Even if the answer has multiple issues, identify only specific problematic spans
- Each span should be a meaningful fragment (phrase, sentence, or clause level)
- **Avoid overly granular word-by-word marking unless necessary**

### Validation Checklist
Before outputting, verify each span:
- ✓ Is this span an exact substring from the answer?
- ✓ Does this span actually contain hallucinated content not supported by passages?
- ✓ Is this span not the entire answer?
- ✓ Is this span meaningful and coherent?

=========================
## Examples

**Example 1: Factual Contradiction**
- Question: "What was the patient's diagnosis?"
- Passages mention: "diagnosed with bronchitis"
- Answer: "The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and prescribed antibiotics for 10 days"
- Reference supports: bronchitis diagnosis, antibiotics mentioned but not duration
- Valid Output: `{"hallucination_list": ["pneumonia", "10 days"]}` ✓

**Example 2: Unsupported Claim**
- Question: "What are the benefits of the new drug?"
- Passages mention: "showed promising results in trials"
- Answer: "The drug reduces symptoms by 75% and has no side effects"
- Reference doesn't support specific percentage or side effect claims
- Valid Output: `{"hallucination_list": ["75%", "has no side effects"]}` ✓

**Example 3: No Hallucinations**
- Question: "What did the study conclude?"
- Passages state: "study concluded that exercise improves mental health"
- Answer: "The study concluded that regular exercise can improve mental health outcomes"
- Valid Output: `{"hallucination_list": []}` ✓

**Example 4: Multiple Issues**
- Answer with several problems across different spans
- Invalid: `{"hallucination_list": ["The entire answer contradicts..."]}` ✗ (entire answer)
- Valid: `{"hallucination_list": ["95% effectiveness", "approved by FDA", "no contraindications"]}` ✓ (specific spans)

**Example 5: Fabricated Details**
- Answer: "Dr. Smith, lead researcher at Harvard University, published these findings in Nature journal"
- Passages mention research but not specific author, institution, or publication
- Valid Output: `{"hallucination_list": ["Dr. Smith, lead researcher at Harvard University", "in Nature journal"]}` ✓

=========================

**After outputting the JSON, stop immediately. Do not add any explanation, reasoning, or repeat the JSON.**
