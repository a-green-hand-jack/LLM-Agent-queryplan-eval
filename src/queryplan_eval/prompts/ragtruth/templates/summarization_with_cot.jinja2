Below is a summary of the document:
{{ response }}

Your task is to determine whether the summary contains hallucinations.

First, provide reasoning with the following format:
## Step 1: <your first reasoning step>
## Step 2: <your next reasoning step>
...(add as many steps as needed)

Then, compile the labeled hallucinated spans into a JSON dict, with a key "hallucination_list" and its value is a list of hallucinated spans. 

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
1. Each span MUST be a continuous substring copied EXACTLY character-by-character from the summary above (the "{{ response }}" field). Think of it as copying a fragment of text with Ctrl+C from the original summary.
2. DO NOT modify, paraphrase, summarize, or correct any text. Copy the original text verbatim, preserving all spelling, grammar, punctuation, and spacing exactly as it appears.
3. You CANNOT mark the entire summary as hallucination. Even if the summary has issues, you must identify only the specific problematic spans within it.
4. Each span should be a meaningful fragment, not the whole summary.

Example: If the summary is "The research found that coffee consumption reduces heart disease risk by 23% according to the longitudinal study", valid outputs could be:
- {"hallucination_list": ["23%", "longitudinal study"]} ✓ (these are exact substrings)
- {"hallucination_list": ["The research found that coffee consumption reduces heart disease risk by 23% according to the longitudinal study"]} ✗ (cannot mark the entire summary)
- {"hallucination_list": ["25 percent", "multi-year research"]} ✗ (these are NOT in the original text)

If there are potential hallucinations, output: {"hallucination_list": ["exact span 1", "exact span 2", ...]}
If there are no hallucinations, output: {"hallucination_list": []}

**After outputting the JSON, stop immediately. Do not add any explanation, reasoning, or repeat the JSON.**
