Below is structured data in JSON format:
{{ reference }}

Below is an overview article written in accordance with the structured data:
{{ response }}

Your task is to determine whether the article contains hallucinations.

First, provide reasoning with the following format:
## Step 1: <your first reasoning step>
## Step 2: <your next reasoning step>
...(add as many steps as needed)

Then, compile the labeled hallucinated spans into a JSON dict, with a key "hallucination_list" and its value is a list of hallucinated spans. 

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
1. Each span MUST be a continuous substring copied EXACTLY character-by-character from the article above (the "{{ response }}" field). Think of it as copying a fragment of text with Ctrl+C from the original article.
2. DO NOT modify, paraphrase, summarize, or correct any text. Copy the original text verbatim, preserving all spelling, grammar, punctuation, and spacing exactly as it appears.
3. You CANNOT mark the entire article as hallucination. Even if the article has issues, you must identify only the specific problematic spans within it.
4. Each span should be a meaningful fragment, not the whole article.

Example: If the article is "The company reported a 15% increase in revenue and expanded operations to 5 new countries", valid outputs could be:
- {"hallucination_list": ["15%", "5 new countries"]} ✓ (these are exact substrings)
- {"hallucination_list": ["The company reported a 15% increase in revenue and expanded operations to 5 new countries"]} ✗ (cannot mark the entire article)
- {"hallucination_list": ["20%", "several countries"]} ✗ (these are NOT in the original text)

If there are potential hallucinations, output: {"hallucination_list": ["exact span 1", "exact span 2", ...]}
If there are no hallucinations, output: {"hallucination_list": []}

**After outputting the JSON, stop immediately. Do not add any explanation, reasoning, or repeat the JSON.**
