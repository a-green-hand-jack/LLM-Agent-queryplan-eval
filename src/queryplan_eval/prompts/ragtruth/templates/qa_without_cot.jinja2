Your task is to determine whether the answer contains hallucinations.

Then, compile the labeled hallucinated spans into a JSON dict, with a key "hallucination_list" and its value is a list of hallucinated spans. 

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
1. Each span MUST be a continuous substring copied EXACTLY character-by-character from the answer above (the "{{ response }}" field). Think of it as copying a fragment of text with Ctrl+C from the original answer.
2. DO NOT modify, paraphrase, summarize, or correct any text. Copy the original text verbatim, preserving all spelling, grammar, punctuation, and spacing exactly as it appears.
3. You CANNOT mark the entire answer as hallucination. Even if the answer has issues, you must identify only the specific problematic spans within it.
4. Each span should be a meaningful fragment, not the whole answer.

Example: If the answer is "The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and prescribed antibiotics for 10 days", valid outputs could be:
- {"hallucination_list": ["pneumonia", "10 days"]} ✓ (these are exact substrings)
- {"hallucination_list": ["The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and prescribed antibiotics for 10 days"]} ✗ (cannot mark the entire answer)
- {"hallucination_list": ["lung infection", "two weeks"]} ✗ (these are NOT in the original text)

If there are potential hallucinations, output: {"hallucination_list": ["exact span 1", "exact span 2", ...]}
If there are no hallucinations, output: {"hallucination_list": []}

**After outputting the JSON, stop immediately. Do not add any explanation, reasoning, or repeat the JSON.**
